## Hubkit

Using dockerhub images and custom aliases for quick access to tools and shells.

Ideal for pulling down application or framework environments for evaluating its files, default configurations, etc.

Also valuable for ephemeral shells in whatever distribution is necessary: quick Ubuntu shell, CentOS shell, or even a temporary and disposable Kali instances.

Most easily used by sourcing the aliases file and using the keyword/args from command line: `source ./docker_aliases`

More detailed setup and use cases can be found as comments in the aliases file.
